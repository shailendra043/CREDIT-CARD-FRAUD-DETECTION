# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

![Fraud Detection](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200.png?text=Credit+Card+Fraud+Detection)

## Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing a dataset of credit card transactions, we experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implementation of multiple classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests
- Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of results for better understanding and insights

## 🚀 Installation

1. ## Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
    cd credit-card-fraud-detection
    ```

2. ## Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. ## Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about credit card transactions and includes labels indicating whether each transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. Place the dataset file in the `data/` directory.

## 🛠 Usage

1. ## Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. **Open the notebook:**
    Open the `credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb` notebook in your browser.

3. ## Follow the steps:
    - Importing Libraries
    - Defining Paths and Checking Files
    - Loading and Preprocessing the Dataset
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    - Splitting the Data
    - Training and Evaluating Models
    - Comparing Model Performance

4. ## Run each cell to execute the code and observe the outputs.

## 📈 Model Performance
We evaluate the performance of three different classifiers: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. The best-performing model can be chosen for deployment based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
